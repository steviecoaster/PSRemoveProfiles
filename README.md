# PSRemoveProfiles
Remove stale user profiles from Windows machines

This GUI utility loads all user profiles currently on a machine.
Selecting the checkbox beside each profile and then pressing "Remove Profile", will delete the profile from the system.

The list then refreshes to reflect the changes, and shows the remaining profiles after the cleanup.
